# Unforgivable-vigilance

Do you know that online surveillance is widespread and constant? If you're concerned about being monitored, don't worry - there are ways to defend yourself. Here are a few helpful tips to protect your online privacy.

The internet is ruled by powerful entities such as **governments**, **_hackers_**, and **_crackers_** - and they're like mutant gods that seem indestructible—the infinite battle. 
This battle was created the day the internet was born. 

Who is their fan base? You have the right to know!

Several countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Russia, China, Israel, Iran, and North Korea, have active cyber capabilities for both offensive and defensive operations. As they continue developing their cyber capabilities, the likelihood of physical confrontation and violence resulting from a cyber operation increases. But let's be clear - cyber warfare will never escalate to the scale or protracted nature of traditional war.

These countries operate in the shadows while engaging in massive surveillance to spy on targets. Don't let them do it to you! It's time to take control of your online privacy and defend yourself against constant surveillance.

These same countries, today operating in the shadows and massive surveillance, seek to spy on targets.
