# Unforgivable-vigilance
Links that prove online surveillance is constant and some tips on how to defend yourself. 

Many countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Russia, China, Israel, Iran, and North Korea have active cyber capabilities for offensive and defensive operations. As states explore the use of cyber operations and combine capabilities, the likelihood of physical confrontation and violence playing out as a result of, or part of, a cyber operation is increased. However, meeting the scale and protracted nature of war is unlikely, thus ambiguity remains. 

These same countries, today operating in the shadows and massive surveillance, seek to spy on targets.
